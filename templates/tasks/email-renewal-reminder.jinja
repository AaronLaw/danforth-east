  Dear {{ member_first_name }},
</p>
<p>
  It's that time of year again...time to renew your membership with the Danforth East Community Association! The good news is that it's still only $10 for a family membership for a year.  And your $10 helps put on some amazing activities in our community, including the East Lynn Park Farmers' Market, the Danforth East Arts Fair, new businesses coming to the Danforth with the Pop-up Shop Project, the East Lynn Park Pumpkin Parade, the Danforth East Garage Sale, the Holiday Lighting Festival and much more.
</p>
<p>
  To renew your membership, simple go Membership page on the DECA website and fill in the registration form, here.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you again for supporting our community!
</p>
